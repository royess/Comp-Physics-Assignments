# Computational Physics Assignments

Codes in Python.

The content:

1. Solving linear equations.
2. Interpolation, numerical integration.
3. QR decomposition, data processing.
4. Solving differential equations.

I have another repo, where some of these algorithms are implemented in Julia. Please see [royess/numerical-methods-assignments-julia]（https://github.com/royess/numerical-methods-assignments-julia） if you are interested. Julia is a good programming language for writing high-performance program as well as doing benchmarking and testing.
